   Birds - You can use this helpful tool to send any item of choice to another guild, can be useful for sending letters -
    to offline Guilds, they can send back and forth. These aren't just digital, they actually fly around from claimed area to claimed area, -
    (almost in a teleport then wait manner) they will wait at one land for about a minute or so, the land owners will get informed that there is a -
    bird flying over the land, they can then shoot at the bird with a bow to kill it, it has 18 hp (6 full hearts) It moves in loop-d-loops
    The bird will only travel to the lands that are most linear to the lands it's traveling too, so it wont hit all of the Guilds, just a few -
    (In other words, it will only go over a few guilds, it will choose 2-3 that are online so they get a chance to get the things the bird is carrying). -
    These birds are custom skulls with a bit of cloud particles and smoke particles behind, it makes lound chicken noises when the guild is notified when it passes by. -
    When the birds are killed they drop the loot that was being sent, the killers can then pick it up, the senders then get copies of the loot back with the -
    message "Your bird was murdered, we found these gifts for your rememberance", and then the Guild's bird's level ups, (the hp upgrades and potions you can add to it), are knocked back by 1 level.
    This should all happen in the course of 1 minute, so the bird should fly around 4 lands giving 4 guilds a chance, we'll speak about when there's not more than 1 Guild.
   
   Market - This sends items to the market, yet again the bird system is run.. this time a pointless loop back around to the land it -
    was sent from with a message "Tweet.. I couldn't find the market lands. -
    I gave it to a man he said he knew where it was supposed to go" , a virtual shop that has shops by the -
    Guild, so the best items are listed first and the worst are last, sell better items, more people will see them. -
    To be more specific, the shops are listing items in a group with the guild's name, so you can sell stuff through your guild's market.
